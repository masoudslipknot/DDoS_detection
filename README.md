# DDos_detection
<h3> Project Description: </h3>

This is a project that uses SCAPY library for sniffing the live network traffic and based on the flow features DDos attack will be identified.
You can see a very short survey paper for DDos detection. Also, there are slides that give explanation about the flow based features that are extracted and how these feature
can help in detecting the attack.
<b> Normaltraffic.csv </b> is file contaning normal traffic with out existance of DDos attack.
<b> Duringtheattack.csv </b> contains flows with following features during DDos attack. Based on the value of features it is clear that a DDos attack was conducted.
This was my network security course project and no more updates will be provided for this repository.
